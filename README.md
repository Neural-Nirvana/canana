## ‚ú® **What is Visual Prompting with Nano Banana?**

Visual prompting represents the cutting-edge evolution of AI interaction, moving beyond simple text descriptions to sophisticated canvas-based instruction systems. Canana enables you to:

- **Draw directly on canvas** with arrows, circles, and annotations that Nano Banana understands
- **Combine visual cues with natural language** for precise editing control
- **Use multi-turn conversational editing** to refine images iteratively
- **Maintain character consistency** across multiple transformations
- **Blend multiple images** with contextual understanding

This approach leverages **Google's Nano Banana** (officially Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Preview), the world's top-rated image editing model that excels at understanding visual instructions, maintaining lighting consistency, and performing targeted transformations while preserving everything else intact.

## üí° **Pro Tips for Nano Banana Visual Prompting**

### **Arrow Annotation Best Practices**
```
‚úÖ DO: Point arrows at specific objects or areas to edit
‚úÖ DO: Use arrows to indicate lighting direction changes
‚úÖ DO: Combine arrows with descriptive text for clarity
‚ùå DON'T: Overuse arrows - Nano Banana understands context
```

### **Prompt Engineering for Visual Instructions**
```
‚úÖ DO: Write descriptive paragraphs, not keyword lists
‚úÖ DO: Be specific about edits: "make background a neon diner at night"
‚úÖ DO: Use multi-turn editing - change one thing at a time
‚ùå DON'T: Try to change everything in a single prompt
```

### **Canvas Composition Guidelines**
```
‚úÖ DO: Use contrasting colors for instruction markup
‚úÖ DO: Leave space around objects for context understanding
‚úÖ DO: Group related annotations logically
‚ùå DON'T: Overcrowd the canvas with competing instructions
```

### **Lighting and Consistency Tips**
```
‚úÖ DO: Trust Nano Banana's lighting consistency algorithms
‚úÖ DO: Use arrows to indicate desired light source direction
‚úÖ DO: Annotate material properties for realistic rendering
‚ùå DON'T: Over-specify technical details - describe naturally
